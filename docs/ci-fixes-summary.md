# CI/CD Intermittent Failure Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes applied to eliminate intermittent CI/CD failures in the VinylDigger project.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Race Conditions**: Services starting before dependencies were fully ready
2. **Insufficient Health Checks**: Basic health checks didn't ensure services were fully operational
3. **Timeout Issues**: Default timeouts too short for CI environments
4. **Resource Constraints**: CI runners have limited resources causing slower startup times
5. **Network Flakiness**: Occasional network delays in CI environments

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Health Checks (docker-compose.test.yml)

Added `start_period` and increased retries for all services:
- PostgreSQL: 10 retries, 10s start period
- Redis: 10 retries, 10s start period
- Backend API: 15 retries, 30s start period
- Worker: 10 retries, 20s start period
- Frontend: 15 retries, 30s start period

### 2. Improved Service Startup Verification (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

- Added explicit wait commands for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Services now wait for actual connectivity, not just container health
- Added pg_isready and redis-cli ping checks before running tests

### 3. Better E2E Test Reliability (.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml)

- Added detailed service readiness checks
- Increased timeouts for service startup
- Added retry logic for flaky tests (--retries=2)
- Added PLAYWRIGHT_SLOW_MO environment variable

### 4. Playwright Configuration Improvements (playwright.config.ts)

- Increased action timeout in CI: 15s (from 10s)
- Increased navigation timeout in CI: 45s (from 30s)
- Added slowMo: 100ms for CI environments
- Added networkidle wait condition for CI

### 5. Enhanced Just Commands (justfile)

- Improved test-ci command with explicit health checks
- Added visual feedback for service readiness
- Added 5-second stabilization delay after all services are ready

### 6. Debug Script (scripts/debug-ci-failure.sh)

Created comprehensive debug script that collects:
- System information
- Docker status
- Container logs
- Network information
- Service health status
- Recent Docker events

### 7. Automatic Debugging on Failure

E2E test workflow now automatically runs debug script on failure to help diagnose issues.

## Monitoring Intermittent Failures

### If Failures Still Occur

1. **Check the debug output** - The debug script will provide detailed information
2. **Look for patterns**:
   - Time of day (resource contention?)
   - Specific test files (flaky tests?)
   - Specific browsers (browser-specific issues?)
   - Error messages (network timeouts?)

3. **Common patterns to watch for**:
   ```
   - "Connection refused" - Service not ready
   - "Timeout" - Increase timeouts further
   - "ECONNRESET" - Network issues
   - "Container unhealthy" - Check container logs
   ```

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Run debug script locally
./scripts/debug-ci-failure.sh

# Check service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs [service-name]

# Check service health in real-time
watch docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml ps

# Test service connectivity
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml exec postgres pg_isready
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml exec redis redis-cli ping
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Write Resilient Tests**:
   - Always wait for elements before interacting
   - Use data-testid attributes for reliable selectors
   - Avoid timing-based assertions
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Service Dependencies**:
   - Always use health checks
   - Wait for actual functionality, not just container start
   - Add retry logic for network operations

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Keep test data minimal
   - Clean up after tests
   - Use transactions for database tests

## Future Improvements

1. **Consider adding**:
   - Retry mechanism at the job level
   - Separate smoke test suite for quick validation
   - Parallelization limits based on available resources
   - Container resource limits to simulate production

2. **Monitor trends**:
   - Track failure rates over time
   - Identify problematic tests
   - Review resource usage patterns

## Rollback Plan

If these changes cause issues:

1. Revert the GitHub Actions workflow changes
2. Revert docker-compose.test.yml health check changes
3. Keep the debug script for troubleshooting

All changes are backward compatible and can be selectively rolled back.
