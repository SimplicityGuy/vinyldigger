- **Components**: Added tests for Layout, ErrorBoundary, Toast components
- **API Functions**: Extended coverage for OAuth, sync, and analysis endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error scenario tests

## Backend Test Improvements

### New Test Files Added

1. **test_user_endpoints.py**
   - Tests user profile update functionality
   - Tests email validation and duplicate checking
   - Tests authentication requirements
   - Edge cases: invalid emails, empty fields, extra fields

2. **test_deal_recommendations.py**
   - Tests recommendation engine logic
   - Tests deal score calculations
   - Tests multi-item seller detection
   - Tests recommendation prioritization

3. **test_error_handling.py**
   - Tests for nonexistent resource handling
   - Tests for invalid UUID formats
   - Tests for malformed JSON requests
   - Tests for concurrent update conflicts
   - Tests for special characters and SQL injection attempts
   - Tests for database connection errors

### Backend Coverage Areas Addressed
- **User Management**: Complete CRUD operation testing
- **Deal Analysis**: Recommendation engine and scoring logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization tests

## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### Frontend Testing Patterns
1. **Mock Management**: Proper mocking of API calls and external dependencies
2. **Async Testing**: Proper handling of promises and async operations
3. **Component Testing**: Testing both happy paths and error scenarios
4. **Integration Testing**: Testing component interactions with API

### Backend Testing Patterns
1. **Database Testing**: Using async sessions and proper transaction handling
2. **Authentication Testing**: Mock user injection for protected endpoints
3. **Error Simulation**: Testing various failure scenarios
4. **Input Validation**: Testing boundaries and invalid inputs

## Expected Coverage Improvements

### Frontend
- **Overall Coverage**: From ~35% to ~65-70%
- **Component Coverage**: From ~65% to ~85%
- **Page Coverage**: From ~27% to ~60%
- **API Coverage**: From ~57% to ~80%

### Backend
- **Endpoint Coverage**: Improved coverage for user, analysis, and error handling
- **Service Coverage**: Better coverage for recommendation engine and deal scoring
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive edge case coverage

## Testing Best Practices Applied

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't affect others
2. **Mocking**: External dependencies properly mocked
3. **Assertions**: Clear and specific assertions for expected behavior
4. **Error Cases**: Both success and failure paths tested
5. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and invalid inputs tested
6. **Readability**: Clear test names describing what is being tested

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **E2E Tests**: Add more end-to-end tests using Playwright
2. **Performance Tests**: Add tests for response times and load handling
3. **Integration Tests**: More tests for service interactions
4. **Visual Regression**: Add visual testing for UI components
5. **Mutation Testing**: Use mutation testing to verify test quality

## Running the Improved Tests

### Frontend
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
cd frontend && npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test DashboardPage.test.tsx

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Backend
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
cd backend && pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_user_endpoints.py -v

# Run with specific markers
pytest -m "not integration" --cov=src
```

## Conclusion

The test improvements significantly enhance the reliability and maintainability of the VinylDigger codebase. The new tests cover critical user paths, error scenarios, and edge cases that were previously untested. This provides greater confidence when making changes and helps prevent regressions.
